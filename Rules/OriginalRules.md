## Overview:

Two rival developers build towards victory, competing on a single board representing a city development zone.

Each player gets a hand of 7 building cards at the beginning of the game, and draws up to 7 at the start of each turn.

On your turn, you may place a building from your hand onto one of the city blocks at a cost of megabucks and/or people, or alternatively discard a building and pass the turn.

Buildings in play are affected by the 8 blocks around them, so houses produce more people when next to other residences, and landfills harm everything around them. Buildings that look at their surroundings don't care about their controller, either, so your university helps your opponent's houses just as much as they do your own.

There are 3 building types: Residences, Businesses, and Public Services:
1. Residences produce people, boosted by nearby residences.
1. Businesses produce megabucks, often boosted by nearby residences which provide their business.
1. Public Services do a variety of things, ranging from boosting nearby businesses to taking extra turns to winning the game.

Victory is achieved in two ways:
1. The primary method is to attain the legendary Gigabuck (composed of 1024 megabucks), which grants you wealth and fame enough to secure your career for a lifetime...
2. Alternatively, controlling a University and 100 people allows the development of AI-controlled cities. You become the head of a trillion-dollar city planning program, eliminating the need for developers altogether...
